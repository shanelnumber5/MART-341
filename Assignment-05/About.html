    alt="Alvin Schwartz is an older, Caucasian gentleman, with a beard, who
    is also bald. Alvin Schwartz seems to be wearing a black sweater, but the
    picture is in black and white, so I am unsure.  He is very friendly looking
    like a stereotypical Santa Claus."

    <img src="images/Stephen_Gammell.jpg"
    alt="Stepen Gammel actually looks a lot like Alvin Schwartz.  But Gammel has
    round glasses and is wearing baggier clothes.  He looks very serious in
    this photo, which is also black and white."
