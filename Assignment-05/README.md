### 1. Visit a site using The Wayback Machine, looking at a snapshot at least 10 years old. Where did you go? What did it look like? How has it changed?

[World of Warcraft](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/new-site)

<p>I actually went back as far back as 2001 when I used to play <i>World of Warcraft</i> in high school.  This was actually done on a ruby red desktop Macintosh with dial up internet.  I would directly have to connect with my friends and if we received a call on the landline, it would drop my game.</p>

<p>I actually had to go to todays version to see how it has changed because I haven't played in years.  Thematically the site has a very similar feel, but of course the graphics and animations have dramatically changed.  From my perspective, the biggest change with most websites is how user friendly the technology has become in general.</p>
