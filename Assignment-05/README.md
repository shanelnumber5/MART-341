### 1. Visit a site using The Wayback Machine, looking at a snapshot at least 10 years old. Where did you go? What did it look like? How has it changed?

[World of Warcraft](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/new-site)

<p>
I went back as far back as 2001 when I used to play <i>World of Warcraft</i> in high school.  I played this game on a ruby red desktop Macintosh with dial up internet.  I would directly have to connect with my friends and if we received a call on the landline, it would drop my game.
</p>

<p>
I had to go to today's version to see how it has changed because I haven't played in years.  Thematically the site has a very similar feel, but of course the graphics and animations have dramatically changed.  From my perspective, the biggest change with most websites is how user friendly the technology has become in general.

### 2. Summarize your experience with these last few topics. What did you learn? What was difficult, easy, or still misunderstood?

<p>
Taking <i>Creative Coding I</i>, really helped clarify a lot of these topics earlier.  I feel like I can be way more creative as we build upon many of the topics presented because I am way more competent in the use of the material.  I also feel like when the topics are explained I understand the "how and why" of the material itself.
</p>

<b>Things I have learned in the last few topics:</b>
* How to describe something visual for the visually impared.
* How to use line breaks effectively.
* Implementing horizontal rules.
* Using preformatted text correctly.
