    alt="This is a trilogy of books.  They have a thick black border and a
    thin red border on the inside.  All drawings were done in black ink and
    charcoal.  In the first book, there is a decomposing head smoking a pipe
    and a dilapidated house in the background.  In the second book, there seems
    to be two children holding hands in a dead forest.  In the third book,
    there are three ghostly looking heads floating in the air.  There seems
    to be goo or slime hanging off them."

      Alvin Schwartz compiled the short stories for these books through use of
      American folklore.  Schwartz collected these stories and turned them into
      tales of horror and revenge guaranteed to “chill your bones".

      According to the American Library Association, the series was the single
      most banned and challenged books in the United States.  This was a result
      of many people believing the content and illustrations to be of
      “inappropriate” content for children.  Between the gruesome stories and
      graphic surrealist style illustrations, many adults believed it would
      traumatize a whole generation of children.

      Although many of the stories seemed unforgettable in and of themselves,
      the drawings were quite scary and seem to have a lasting impression on the
      readers themselves.  In 2011, for the 30th anniversary of Scary Stories to
      Tell in the Dark, the books were rereleased with different illustrations
      from Brett Helquist.  Many original fans of the books complained about the
      new version of the illustrations being “watered down and not that scary
      anymore”.  This outcry caused the books to be rereleased with original
      artwork by Stephen Gammell in 2017.
