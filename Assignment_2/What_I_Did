On a new line, summarize what you did this week, discuss any challenges and successes you had.

I created a new repository, edited a file, created a new file, and uploaded a new file.  
Sometimes the "push" and "pull" in Github is hard to use, but I am getting better at using it.
I hope to learn how to make some cool things and maybe go off the beaten path (within reason).
