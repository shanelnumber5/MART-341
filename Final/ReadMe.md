# Final ReadMe Questions and Answers

## 1. Did you learn anything new about web development (i.e., using GitHub, version control, repositories)?

Every week I learned something new, what kind of question is this?!

## 2. Did you learn anything new about web design (i.e., using media, color, fonts)?

I think I just have too many choices at times, it is kind of a rabbit hole for me.

## 3. Free Response: Discuss any challenges you had and what you did to overcome them

I was planning on switching my domain at WIX over to something I could actually modify, little did I know that switching hosting sites was such a big deal for my established domain.  I was on the phone half the day with HostGator after watching a video on how to do it.  As of right now my website is still in limbo, but as soon as it is active I will upload my final assignment onto my own personal website.  I wasn't aware how many things I have made in the past.  The external pages connected to my portfolio were crazy to put together because of the amount of things I have made.
