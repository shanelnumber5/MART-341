## 3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
Sometimes certain weeks can seem overwhelming in these types of classes.  I think I felt somewhat overwhelmed this week.  I had to break things into sections and really take it apart piece by piece like the walkthrough video suggested.  I have noticed my typing in general has become significantly faster and more accurate as I progress though the work.  There really is so many options and visuals that my creativity kind of gets out of hand and I get off on tangents because I find the information to be so interesting.
