## 3. Free Response: What challenges did you have this week? How did you overcome them?

I was having trouble understanding the difference between spans and divs so I went to YouTube and found a video that described the difference between these two elements.  I came across this video [HTML & CSS for Beginners Part 10: Divs & Spans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2bzap43cNQ), which really helped break down the difference for me.  I found this week to be very interesting with a side of information overload.  I know every week is going to be like this for the remainder of the semester, but sometimes I feel like I can't seem to learn enough information on the topics.  I did learn how to directly push my work directly from Atom to GitHub, which was pretty cool.
