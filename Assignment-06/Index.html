        Expert Tips
      </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a very large stock pot to make Apple Pie Moonshine cocktail
              recipe. Sometimes I even divide the ingredients between my two
              largest stock pots.</li>
          <li>You can use any size canning jars that you have to store this
              Apple Pie Moonshine Everclear.  You aren't going to do the entire
              canning process.  Just fill the jars and make sure they are
              tightly sealed.</li>
          <li>Before sealing the jars place a new cinnamon stick in each jar
              - don't reuse the cinnamon sticks you strained out.</li>
          <li>When you make Apple Pie Moonshine recipe, make sure you store the
              jars in a cool, dark place to mellow out for a few weeks before
              enjoying them.</li>
          <li>There may be some sediment from the cinnamon stick in the jar
              - simple strain it through cheesecloth.</li>
          <li>Make sure you enjoy this cocktail responsibly</li>
        </ul>
