# Assignment 9 ReadMe Questions and Answers

## 1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

Older Elements We Revisited:
* The four main document elements.
* Head elements.
* Semantic markup.
* Lists
* Forms
* Form input elements.
* Submit buttons.
* Ids
* Classes
* Divs
* Maps in the Iframe element.
* Media in the Ifame element.
* The image element.

Newer/Interesting Elements:
* The difference between inline and embedded styling and which one takes precedence over the other.
* How to visually format structural elements of a page.
* Changing the width of the div.
* How to use padding and what it is.
* Different types of navigation elements (not going to lie, kind of excited to use this element)

Difficult Elements:
* The use of an external stylesheet: I remember doing a little bit of this in our Creative Coding I class, so I know that the material starts becoming even more complicated at that point.  But it could have been because coding was so new to me!
* Background and regular images and how to format them accordingly.

## 2. Next module we continue with CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

I am excited to have more freedom in my decorative elements, but I just remember how difficult it was for me to create one last semester.  Honestly with the help of YouTube and Jon Duckett, I think I might survive  &#128540;.


## 3. Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes. What did you do to overcome your challenges?
I just looked over material again and went to the W3 School site a lot.  I struggled with the inline text and adding spaces to certain things.  I think I might be able to do this competently.
