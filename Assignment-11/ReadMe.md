## 1. What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?

### System Font:
* Available and local to the type of device you use.
* They might not be on the web, so they are usually used in licensing or logos.

### Web Font:
* Custom fonts used on your server.
* It is recommended to have a "fallback font" in case the initial font chosen does not exsist for the website user.

### Web-Safe Font:
* Available to everyone because they are available through all systems.
* Increases performance and reduces load time.

## 2. What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?
If the browser cannot find the original client font, then the browser will use the next font listed.  This is basically a fail safe for your chosen font types.

## 3. Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and what you did to overcome them.
Remembering if I was using the style sheet or the font sheet.  I couldn't figure out why the style sheet was not working when I kept adjusting the font sheet for a while there.  The other silly mistake I kept making was adjusting to things I was calling out and not realizing I needed to go further down the sheet and look for the appropriate h1 heading to change instead.  The coolest thing I think I did this week on a whim was to add an image icon up where the title is of the book itself.  I get really into some of these assignments and can't stop working on them sometimes.
